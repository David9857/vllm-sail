"""vLLM version compatibility for the PPU plugin.

**Policy (learned from vllm-ascend, which got this wrong):** version gates live
*only* in this module and in patch-module *selection*. Never call
:func:`vllm_version_is` from a hot path — vllm-ascend has 28 such call sites
inside its model runner and attention code and calls it out as a mistake.

Release-tag manifests use the release range below. Commit-pinned checkpoints require
the full source commit recorded in both ``.github/vllm-main-verified.commit``
and ``csrc/upstream/manifest.toml``. The latter ships inside the wheel, so the
same identity check works outside a source checkout.
