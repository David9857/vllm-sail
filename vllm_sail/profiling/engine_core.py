"""NVTX instrumentation for ``vllm/v1/engine/core.py``.

Port of the fork's engine-core hunks (+59 lines) as delegating patches, per
``docs/developer_guide/architecture.md``:

* ``EngineCore.__init__`` gains the ``self.iteration`` counter.
* ``step`` / ``step_with_batch_queue`` are wrapped in the
  ``[prof_range]: iter N`` range plus the ``prof_iter`` hook.

Deviations from the fork, all deliberate and documented in the patch
metadata: the fork opened each range *after* ``scheduler.schedule()`` and
skipped it when no requests were pending; the wrappers open it around the
whole method instead. The range therefore spans scheduling as well (nested
inside the ``schedule`` NVTX range anyway) and empty steps get a range too.
The fork's ``sche_mark`` call is covered by the scheduler patch module,
which marks every scheduler output in this process exactly once.

Installed only by ``vllm_sail.profiling.install()`` when
``VLLM_SAIL_NVTX_PROFILE`` is set; never imported otherwise.
