"""Dequantise INT8 / FP8-per-channel MLA projections of GLM-5.3-Flash on load.

``Glm5NextDecoderLayer`` builds ``Glm5NextMLAAttention`` with
``quant_config=None`` ("MLA projections are BF16 in checkpoint").  That holds
for the FP8 checkpoints the model was written against, whose q_a_proj /
kv_a_proj_with_mqa / q_b_proj / o_proj are stored block-FP8 and dequantised to
BF16 by ``_try_load_fp8_attn_proj``.  It does *not* hold for INT8 dense
checkpoints (``mixed_precision_w4``): there the same four projections are
``int8`` with a per-output-channel ``float32`` ``weight_scale``.

With the upstream loader those weights fall through to the regular path and
``default_weight_loader`` copies the raw int8 values into the BF16 parameters
(``param.data.copy_`` casts silently), while the ``.weight_scale`` tensors are
captured by the FP8 branch (``is_scale``), find no ``weight_scale_inv`` target
and are dropped without a missing-parameter error.  Every MLA layer then runs
with weights inflated by ``1 / weight_scale`` (measured on the GLM-5.3-Flash
INT4-MoE/INT8-dense checkpoint: q_a 2171x, kv_a 1519x, q_b 1155x, o_proj
1207x), the attention scores saturate and the residual stream grows from 0.008
to ~2500 rms over the 11 DSA layers -> garbled first token.

The replacement below is the upstream function with three additions:

* ``int8`` weights are accepted by ``is_weight`` and dequantised with their
  per-channel scale (``weight.float() * scale``) before being handed to the
  parameter's ``weight_loader``;
* FP8 per-output-channel weights (Quark ``weight_scale`` with shape [out] or
  [out, 1], used by FP8-PerChannel checkpoints) are dequantised row-wise
  instead of being forced through the block-FP8 map;
* when the target parameter is itself quantised (``weight_scale_inv`` or
  ``weight_scale`` present), both the weight and its scale are handed back to
  the regular quantised loader instead of being dequantised.

The FP8 block-dequant path, the NoPE kv_a padding and the loading order are
unchanged.
