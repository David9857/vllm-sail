"""Keep basic PyNccl communication usable without PCCL suspend/resume APIs.

PPU's NCCL-compatible library may omit communicator memory suspension. Upstream
already tolerates those missing symbols on ROCm; PPU needs the same loader
policy. All other symbol requirements and the per-library caches stay upstream.
