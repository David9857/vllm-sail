"""Lightly-adapted upstream vLLM tests (CI category 5, ``mode = "adapted"``).

An ``adapted`` entry reuses an upstream test file whose *skeleton and
assertions* are valid for vllm-sail, but which mixes CPU-runnable logic with
device / distributed / network nodes, or carries a handful of known-failing
cases. The adaptation is data-driven and **never edits upstream source**:

* node narrowing (``markers`` / ``keywords`` / ``deselect``) and ``env``
  overrides are declared in ``REUSE_MANIFEST.toml`` and translated into pytest
  argv / environment by :class:`~tests.upstream_reuse._reuse_harness.UpstreamRunner`;
* expected failures (``xfail``) are reconciled here: a declared-xfail node that
  fails is tolerated, any *other* failure is a real regression;
* ``skip_reason`` parks an entry whose upstream prerequisites are not yet met
  (e.g. a warm offline tokenizer cache) without deleting it, keeping the intent
  auditable.

A fourth path is conditional on the runtime instead of declared in the manifest:
``offline_hub_gap`` skips an entry that would have to resolve a checkpoint from
the Hugging Face hub when this runtime has no route to it and no local copy,
which is a hang rather than a failure otherwise. Unlike ``skip_reason`` it costs
nothing in CI, where the hub is reachable and the entry runs for real.

All of that reconciliation logic lives in this module, so following an upstream
bump only the manifest data changes -- never the upstream files.
